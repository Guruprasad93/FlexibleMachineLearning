# Engineering flexible machine learning systems by traversing functionally-invariant paths

Welcome to the official GitHub repository accompanying our latest research paper. Our work dives deep into building flexible machine learning systems that can be used in continual learning, sparsifying neural networks, or reducing adversarial attacks.

## Getting Started

This repository contains the codebase and sample notebooks to run the scripts. Please refer to the notebooks for installation instructions, usage guidelines, and insights into our methodology.

### Notebooks
`FIP_VIT.ipynb`: [![Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UICCGijTeugrhhRSL4PQ0GOBM_mHcC70?usp=sharing): 
In this Google Colab notebook, we will be running the continual learning script to learn new tasks with the reduction of catastrophic forgetting of the previous learnt tasks using FIP.

`LoRA_VIT.ipynb`: [![Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IfQzwpYOh6Lr6fbljIXxpfxjhP6qQRkC?usp=sharing): 
In this Google Colab notebook, we will be running the continual learning script to learn new tasks using LoRA adapter.
